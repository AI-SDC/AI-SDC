# Content

The two main elements are contained in "attacks" and "safemodels".

## example_notebooks

Contains short tutorials on  the basic concept of 'safe_XX' versions of Machine Learning algorithms, and examples of some specific algorithms.

## risk_examples

Contain hypothetical examples of data leakage through machine learning models as described in the Green Paper [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6896214.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6896214)

## Examples

Contain examples of code on how to run the code contained in this repository:
- How to simulate attribute inference attacks (attribute_inference_example.py).
- How to simulate membership inference attacks:
  - Worst case scenario attack (worst_case_attack_example.py)
  - LIRA scenario attack (lira_attack_example.py).
- Integration of attacks into safemodel classes (safemodel_attack_integration_bothcalls.py).
