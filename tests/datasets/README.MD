# README.MD in directory tests/datasets

This folder (and its subfolders) contain extremely truncated verdions of a few datasets **for testing purposes only**.

In general we have only included the first 5 examples of each class within each dataset.

## Full details of the datasets including access requirements and accreditation may be found in the file preprocessing/loaders.py

### Please refer to that file for usage and download instructions.
