# Examples

This folder contains examples of how to run the code contained in this repository.

## Scripts

* How to simulate attribute inference attacks: `attribute_inference_example.py`.
* How to simulate membership inference attacks:
    - Worst case scenario attack: `worst_case_attack_example.py`.
    - LIRA scenario attack: `lira_attack_example.py`.
* Integration of attacks into safemodel classes `safemodel_attack_integration_bothcalls.py`.

## Notebooks

The `notebooks` folder contains short tutorials on the basic concept of "safe_XX" versions of machine learning algorithms, and examples of some specific algorithms.

## Risk Examples

The `risk_examples` folder contains hypothetical examples of data leakage through machine learning models as described by [Jefferson et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6896214).
