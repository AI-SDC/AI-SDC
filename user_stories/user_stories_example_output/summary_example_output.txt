ATTACK JSON RESULTS
Final score (scale of 0-5, where 0 is least disclosive and 5 is recommend rejection)
4


Immediate rejection recommended for the following reason:
None

Evidence supporting rejection:
>10% AUC are statistically significant in experiment WorstCaseAttack_ff7197ef-162d-45c2-80d9-f3b895e3c421

==============================
DESCRIPTION OF FILES
Please note: this is a draft of a possible output that could be produced - feedback is appreciated!
final_score (or summary risk level): a score from 0-5
     a score of 5 means the model is highly disclosive
     a score of 1 (or an empty file) means the model is not found to be disclosive
score_breakdown: for each of the tests that were run and indicated a disclosive model, a score of the impact on risk is provided (1-5, 5 is most disclosive).
     This list is used to calculate the final_score above
score_descriptions: for each tests that were run and indicated a disclosive model, a description of the test is provided
     This information can be used by the researcher to improve their models
